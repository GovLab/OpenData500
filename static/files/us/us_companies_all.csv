Open Data Nation (opendatanation.com) creates plug-and-play, productivity-based solutions that combine open, public data with data science techniques to increase transparency and productivity of public agencies. Open Data Nation does more than map and dashboard open data. We use open data to predict outcomes, prioritize resources, and establish data-driven performance metrics.


Open Data Nation is developing a suite of enterprise solutions to tackle the most pressing urban issues, by using open data science. With a click of a button, Open Data Nation’s applications suggest how to allocate resources in real-time, measures the increase speed and cost savings of data-driven decisions, and sets new performance metrics. In doing so, our solutions dynamically quantify a return on investment and isolate unexpected deviations that may signal the need for retraining or the presence of corruption. 


For example, FIVAR (which stands for Food Inspections Violations, Anticipating Risk) uses open data to anticipate which restaurants are likely to have a health code violation (FIVAR.org). By sending inspectors to these locations first, FIVAR identifies 27% more violations, 3 days sooner, and saves an estimated $2 million, on average, each year.
