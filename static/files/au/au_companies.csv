Our anodes protect billions of dollars worth of infrastructure around Australia, the South Pacific and South East Asia including industrial anodes for offshore oil rigs, floating FPSOs, mining, construction and pipelines as well as for the protection of infrastructure such as ports, wharves, sheet pile walls and desalination plants. Our anodes also protect ships, yachts, marine motors, tanks and hot water systems.

Since commencing manufacturing in 1984, we have established ourselves as Australia’s largest galvanic anode manufacturer. Our foundry is designed based on Lean Manufacturing principals, where work flow efficiency gains and minimal down time has lead to significantly shorter lead times and reduced energy use.

An integral part of our commitment to providing high quality anodes is our laboratories which include an Optical Emission Spectrometer for chemical analysis, electrochemical test baths, anode-to-core resistance testing and more.

IAG uses natural hazard and weather information to get a clearer understanding of the impact of a major event, such as a cyclone, bushfire or flood, before, during and after they strike.  This allows IAG to scale their major event response rapidly to help affected customers recover from the event quickly, as well as notify our business partners, such as reinsurers, and the share market of the impact.

IAG also has specialised teams with advanced analytics capabilities who use census demographics to deliver market leading insights to enhance and constantly improve the customer experience.
