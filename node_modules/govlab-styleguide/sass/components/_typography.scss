/*
Paragraphs

All paragraphs are wrapped in <code>p</code> tags. Additionally, <code>p</code>
elements can be wrapped with a <code>blockquote</code> element <em>if the <code>p</code>
element is indeed a quote</em>. Historically, <code>blockquote</code> has been used
purely to force indents, but this is now achieved using CSS. Reserve <code>blockquote</code>
for quotes.

Markup:
<p>All paragraphs are wrapped in <code>p</code> tags.</p>

/*
Horizontal Rule

The <code>hr</code> element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change
in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book. The following
extract from <cite>Pandora&#8217;s Star</cite> by Peter F. Hamilton shows two paragraphs that
precede a scene change and the paragraph that follows it:

Markup:
<p>Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwearth could be appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.</p>
<p><i>Maybe it won&#8217;t be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night&#8217;s shift.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow of Gralmond&#8217;s winters.</p>

/*
Blockquotes

The <code>blockquote</code> element represents a section that is being quoted from another source.

Markup:
<blockquote cite="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206">
    <p>Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.</p>

/*
Lists

Styles for both ordered and unordered lists are available.
Include block elements within a single list item as appropriate.
Sometimes we may want each list item to contain block elements, typically a paragraph or two.

Markup:
<!-- example of a list using multiple block level elements inside the li -->
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The British Isles is an archipelago consisting of the two large islands of Great Britain and Ireland, and many smaller surrounding islands.</p>

    </li>
</ul>

/*
Ordered List

The <code>ol</code> element denotes an ordered list, and various numbering schemes
are available through the CSS (including 1,2,3&#8230; a,b,c&#8230; i,ii,iii&#8230; and so on).
Each item requires a surrounding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag,
to denote individual items within the list (as you may have guessed, <code>li</code> stands for list item).

Markup:
<ol>
    <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
    <li>
        This is the second item, which contains a sub list
        <ol>
            <li>This is the sub list, which is also ordered.</li>
            <li>It has two items.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>This is the final item on this list.</li>
</ol>

Styleguide 2.4.1
*/

/*
Unordered List

The <code>ul</code> element denotes an unordered list (ie. a list of loose items that
don&#8217;t require numbering, or a bulleted list). Again, each item requires a surrounding
<code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag, to denote individual items.
Here is an example list showing the constituent parts of the British Isles:

Markup:
<ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

/*
Definition List

The <code>dl</code> element is for another type of list called a definition list.
Instead of list items, the content of a <code>dl</code> consists of <code>dt</code>
(Definition Term) and <code>dd</code> (Definition description) pairs.
Though it may be called a &#8220;definition list&#8221;, <code>dl</code> can apply
to other scenarios where a parent/child relationship is applicable. For example,
it may be used for marking up dialogues, with each <code>dt</code> naming a speaker,
and each <code>dd</code> containing his or her words.

Markup:
<dl>
    <dt>This is a term.</dt>
    <dd>This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.</dd>
    <dt>Here is another term.</dt>
    <dd>And it gets a definition too, which is this line.</dd>
    <dt>Here is term that shares a definition with the term below.</dt>
    <dt>Here is a defined term.</dt>
    <dd><code>dt</code> terms may stand on their own without an accompanying <code>dd</code>, but in that case they <em>share</em> descriptions with the next available <code>dt</code>. You may not have a <code>dd</code> without a parent <code>dt</code>.</dd>

Text Semantics

There are a number of inline <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
elements you may use anywhere within other elements.

Styleguide 2.6
*/

/*
Emphasis and Italic, Strong and Bold

The <code>em</code> element is used to denote text with stressed emphasis,
i.e., something you&#8217;d pronounce differently. Where italicizing is
required for stylistic differentiation, the <code>i</code> element may be preferable.

The <code>i</code> element is used for text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset
from the normal prose. Examples include taxonomic designations, technical terms, idiomatic
phrases from another language, the name of a ship or other spans of text whose typographic
presentation is typically italicised.

The <code>strong</code> element is used to denote text with strong importance. Where bolding
is used for stylistic differentiation, the <code>b</code> element may be preferable.

The <code>b</code> element is used for text stylistically offset from normal prose
without conveying extra importance, such as key words in a document abstract, product
names in a review, or other spans of text whose typographic presentation is typically
emboldened.

Markup:
<p>You simply <em>must</em> try the negitoro maki!</p>

/*
Small Print

The <small>small</small> element is used to represent disclaimers, caveats,
legal restrictions, or copyrights (commonly referred to as &#8216;small print&#8217;).
It can also be used for attributions or satisfying licensing requirements.

Markup:
<p><small>Copyright &#169; 1922-2011 Acme Corporation. All Rights Reserved.</small></p>

Styleguide 2.6.3

/*
Strikethrough vs. Del

The <code>s</code> element is used to represent content that is no longer accurate
or relevant. When indicating document edits i.e., marking a span of text as having been
removed from a document, use the <code>del</code> element instead.

The <code>del</code> element is used to represent deleted or retracted text which still must
remain on the page for some reason. Meanwhile its counterpart, the <code>ins</code> element,
is used to represent inserted text. Both <code>del</code> and <code>ins</code> have a
<code>datetime</code> attribute which allows you to include a timestamp directly in the element.

/*
Citations

The <code>cite</code> element is used to represent the title of a work
(e.g. a book, essay, poem, song, film, TV show, sculpture, painting,
musical, exhibition, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted
or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work
that is mentioned in passing.

/*
Abbreviation

The <code>abbr</code> element is used for any abbreviated text,
whether it be acronym, initialism, or otherwise. Generally, it&#8217;s
less work and useful (enough) to mark up only the first occurrence of
any particular abbreviation on a page, and ignore the rest. Any text
in the <code>title</code> attribute will appear when the user&#8217;s
mouse hovers the abbreviation (although notably, this does not work in
Internet Explorer for Windows).

Time

The <code>time</code> element is used to represent either a time on a
24 hour clock, or a precise date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar,
optionally with a time and a time-zone offset.

Markup:

Marked or highlighted text

The <code>mark</code> element is used to represent a run of text marked or highlighted
for reference purposes. When used in a quotation it indicates a highlight not originally
present but added to bring the reader&#8217;s attention to that part of the text. When used
in the main prose of a document, it indicates a part of the document that has been
highlighted due to its relevance to the user&#8217;s current activity.
