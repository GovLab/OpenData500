# govlab-styleguide

A styleguide / lightweight frontend framework for GovLab websites.

This is a living styleguide generated by [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node) and built on top of a super lightweight custom build of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), which aims to be easily reusable for any project within the GovLab ecosystem.
