<h1 class="first-title">About the Open Data 100 Mexico</h1>

<section class="intro">
	<p>The Open Data 100 Mexico is part of the Federal Government of Mexico's Open Data initiative, and is the first comprehensive study of Mexican companies and NGO's that use open government data to generate new business, develop new products and services or create social value. Open Data is free, public data that can be used, reused and redistributed to launch commercial and nonprofit ventures, do research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.</p>
</section>

<section id="about-goals">
	<h2>Study Objectives</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Provide a basis for assessing the economic and social value of government open data.</li>
		<li>Encourage the development of new open data companies.</li>
		<li>Foster a dialogue between government and the private sector on how government data can be made more useful.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section id="about-govlab-approach">
	<h2>Approach</h2>
	<p>Publishing public government data as “open data” is a gradual process. Therefore, this study will seek small, medium, and large companies/organizations from various sectors that are for-profit and non-profit and that use publicly available government data as a key business or operational resource. This includes any information or statistics from government agencies. While most Open Data 100 Mexico companies will work with federal data, we are also interested in those that use city or state data in a way that can scale regionally or nationally.</p>

	<p>In addition, for participating companies and NGO's, the study offers the opportunity to promote their work through a public platform.</p>
</section>

<div class="sub-sections">
	<section id="about-identify" class="m-half">
		<h2 class="m-page-title">Company Identification</h2>
		<p>The Open Data 100 Mexico team will compile the list of companies and NGO's through (1) outreach campaigns, (2) advice from experts and professional organizations, and (3) additional research.</p>

		<p>The results of the study will culminate in an online platform at <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/mx" target="_blank">www.opendata500.com/mx</a>, which will highlight the companies and their use of open government data in Mexico.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="about-what-study-is-not" class="m-half">
		<h2 class="m-page-title">What The Study Is Not</h2>
		<p>The Open Data 100 Mexico is not a rating or ranking of companies. It covers companies and NGO's of different sizes and categories, using various kinds of data. The Open Data 100 Mexico is not a competition, but an attempt to give a broad, inclusive view of the field. The study also does not provide a random sample for definitive statistical analysis. Since this is the first thorough scan of companies in the field, it is not yet possible to determine the exact landscape of open data companies.</p>
	</section>
</div>

<section id="about-approach">
	<h2>About the Open Data Policy</h2>
	<p>For the Government of Mexico, public government data is a priority asset when it is published in open formats and is available to be used, reused and redistributed to create value for and enhance the welfare of all sectors of society.</p>
	<p>The main objective of the Open Data Policy is to articulate a vision focused on facilitating economic growth, strengthening competitiveness and promoting innovation in our country; at the same time, the Policy seeks to create social value, improve the delivery of government services, increase transparency and accountability, and produce greater government efficiency, thereby enhancing governance in the country.</p>
