	<h1>Open Data 100 Mexico <br>Company Survey</h1>

	<p><strong>To qualify for the Mexico Open Data 100, a company must:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Be Mexico-based</strong> (or have a significant portion of operations in Mexico),</li>
		<li><strong>Earn revenue from its products and services</strong> (non-profits may qualify if they have a sustainable revenue stream), and</li>
		<li><strong>Use open government data as a key resource for its business.</strong> (While most Mexico Open Data 100 companies will work with federal data, we are also interested in those that use city or state data in a way that can scale regionally or nationally).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If your company meets these criteria, please take a few minutes to fill out this short online form. Thank you again for your participation.</p>
