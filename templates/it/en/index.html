        <h1>About this Project</h1>
        <p class="intro">Open Data 200 Italy is a joint project designed and
        implemented by the <a href="http://thegovlab.org" target="_blank">Govlab</a>
        in partnership with the
        <a href="http://www.fbk.eu/" target="_blank"><strong>Fondazione Bruno
        Kessler</strong></a>, an international research institute located in Trento, to
        conduct the first comprehensive, internationally comparable study of
        Italian companies that are using open data to generate business,
        develop products and services, and create social value.

  <h2>Study Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide a basis for assessing the social and economic value of open data</li>
    <li>Foster a dialogue between government and companies on how government data can be made more useful</li>
    <li>Identify Italian companies and organizations that use open data for products and services</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="about-govlab-approach">
  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>The Italian Open Data 200 project aims at studying Italian companies that
  use open data in their business activities. The project is being undertaken
  in collaboration between the GovLab at New York University and researchers
  from the <a target="_blank" href="https://digitalcommonslab.fbk.eu/people"><strong>Digital
    Commons Lab</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fbk.eu/">Fondazione
Bruno Kessler</strong></a> (FBK) with the
  support of Italian expert advisors. The Govlab will host  a visiting fellow
  from FBK during the first stage of the study. This collaboration will produce
  a landmark study of how open data is currently being used by Italian
  companies. This study will seek small, medium, and large
  companies/organizations from various sectors that are for-profit and
  non-profit and that use publicly available government data as a key business
  or operational resource. The results are expected to be a valuable resource
  for policymakers to understand the current economic impact and social value
  of open data investments. </p>

<div class="sub-sections">
  <section id="about-identify" class="m-half">
    <h2 class="m-page-title">Company Identification</h2>
    <p>The Open Data 200 Italy team will generate a list of companies through
    (1) outreach campaigns, (2) advice and recommendations from experts and
    professional organizations, and (3) additional research. The results of the
    study will culminate in an online platform at
    <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/it/">www.opendata500.com/it</a> which
    will highlight Italian companies currently using open data.

  <section id="about-what-study-is-not" class="m-half">
    <h2 class="m-page-title">What The Study Is Not</h2>
    <p>The Open Data 200 Italy is not a rating or ranking of companies. It
    covers companies of different sizes and categories, using various kinds of
    data. The Open Data 200 Italy is not a competition, but an attempt to give
    a broad, inclusive view of the field. The study also does not provide
    a random sample for definitive statistical analysis. Since this is the
    first thorough scan of companies in the field, it is not yet possible to
    determine the exact landscape of open data companies.</p>

  <h2>About the Open Data Policy</h2>
  <p>In 2011, Italy joined the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/italy" target="_blank">Open
Government Partnership</a> and launched
  dati.gov.it. Since then, relevant actions in the open data field have been
  undertaken: the release of the <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/documentazione_trasparenza/cdc-spc-gdl6-interoperabilitasemopendata_v2.0_0.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines
    for the semantic interoperability through Linked open data</a> in 2012, the
  introduction of the "Open by Default"
  principle, by modifying the article 52 in the CAD - Codice di Amministrazione
  Digitale (Code for the Digital Administration). In 2013 the
  <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/" target="_blank">Agency for
    digital Italy</a> (AgID) started to elaborate the Italian National Open Data
  <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/documenti_indirizzo/agendanazionalepatrimioniopubblico2014.pdf" target="_blank">Agenda</a>
  and the <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/linee_guida/patrimoniopubblicolg2014_v0.7finale.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines for the Public sector information</a>,
  and finally released them in 2014. In June 2015, a
  <a href="http://www.governo.it/Notizie/Presidenza/dettaglio.asp?d=78661" target="_blank">new version</a> of the dati.gov.it was
  launched. In the meantime, a significant number of open data initiatives has
  been registered at different levels:
  (<a href="http://parlamento17.openpolis.it/" target="_blank">OpenParlamento</a>,
  <a href="http://www.opencoesione.gov.it/" target="_blank">OpenCoesione</a>,
