				<p>The first Open Data Roundtable was held in Washington, DC on June 18, 2014. It was co-hosted by the GovLab and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) together with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs Mark Doms led the Department's planning and engagement with the event, and participated for the entire day. Over 20 other officials and staff from the Department of Commerce participated as well, with appearances by Secretary Penny Pritzker and Acting Deputy Secretary Bruce Andrews. Nick Sinai, U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer, and Erie Meyer, Senior Advisor to the U.S. CTO, represented OSTP at the event. The GovLab is now compiling a report on the Roundtable for public release.</p>
