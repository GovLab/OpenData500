				<p>The Open Data 500 is the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies that use open government data to generate new business and develop new products and services. Open Data is free, public data that can be used to launch commercial and nonprofit ventures, do research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.</p>

					<h2>The Govlab’s Approach</h2>
					<p>The Open Data 500 study is conducted by the GovLab at New York University with funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The GovLab works to improve people’s lives by changing how we govern, using technology-enabled solutions and a collaborative, networked approach. As part of its mission, the GovLab studies how institutions can publish the data they collect as open data so that businesses, organizations, and citizens can analyze and use this information.</p>

					<p>The Open Data 500 is not a rating or ranking of companies. It covers companies of different sizes and categories, using various kinds of data.</p>
					<p>The Open Data 500 is not a competition, but an attempt to give a broad, inclusive view of the field.</p>
					<p>The Open Data 500 study also does not provide a random sample for definitive statistical analysis. Since this is the first thorough scan of companies in the field, it is not yet possible to determine the exact landscape of open data companies.</p>
