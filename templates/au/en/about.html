<h1 class="first-title">About the Open Data 500 Australia</h1>

<section class="intro">
	<p>The Open Data 500 Australia is part of the Commonwealth of Australia's Open Data initiative, and is the first comprehensive study of Australian companies and NGOs that use open government data to generate new business, develop new products and services or create social value. Open Data is free, public data that can be used, reused and redistributed to launch commercial and nonprofit ventures, conduct research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.</p>
</section>

<section id="about-goals">
	<h2>Study Objectives</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Provide a basis for assessing the economic value of government open data
		<li>Encourage the development of new open data companies</li>
		<li>Foster a dialogue between government and business on how government data can be made more useful</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section id="about-govlab-approach">
	<h2>Approach</h2>
	<p>The Australian Open Data 500 Project is a study of Australian companies that use open government data. The project is being undertaken in collaboration between the GovLab, a team of researchers at New York University, and the Australian Government Department of Communications. This collaboration will produce a landmark study of the Australian experience and meets the Australian Government’s open data policy commitments on greater consultation with the private sector on open data.</p>

</section>

<div class="sub-sections">
	<section id="about-identify" class="m-half">
		<h2 class="m-page-title">Company Identification</h2>
		<p>The Open Data 500 Australia team will compile the list of companies and NGOs through (1) outreach campaigns, (2) advice from experts and professional organizations, and (3) additional research.
The results of the study will culminate in an online platform at www.opendata500.com/au, which will highlight the companies and their use of open government data in Australia.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="about-what-study-is-not" class="m-half">
		<h2 class="m-page-title">What The Study Is Not</h2>
		<p>The Open Data 500 Australia is not a rating or ranking of companies. It covers companies of different sizes and categories, using various kinds of data. The Open Data 500 Australia is not a competition, but an attempt to give a broad, inclusive view of the field. The study also does not provide a random sample for definitive statistical analysis. Since this is the first thorough scan of companies in the field, it is not yet possible to determine the exact landscape of open data companies.</p>
	</section>

<section id="open-data-policy">
	<h2>About the Open Data Policy</h2>
	<p>The Australian Government is committed to making more government data, particularly high-value data, openly available to the public and business. The key goal of the policy is to enable Australians to use and re-use the data in innovative ways that stimulate economic growth.</p>
The Australian Open Data 500 Project will create new case studies on how companies are using public sector open data and the benefits this provides to their business.</p>
