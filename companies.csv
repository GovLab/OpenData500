The platform functions as a marketplace helping research scientists find the expertise and services they need at other university labs, core facilities, and contract research organizations. The objective is to help improve the pace of scientific research by improving the efficiency by which researchers can search for, compare and order scientific services on an open marketplace platform.The platform leverages several public datasets to build a central marketplace. We integrate with the Eagle-i database, which was a $15M program funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Eagle-i database includes a list of biomedical resources and university labs that offer services. We integrated our online marketplace to list these facilities' services, so that researchers can easily order their services online. We also, leveraged the PMC Open Access subset to mine publications for core facilities and shared resources noted by researchers. This has allowed Science Exchange to identify utilization of government-sponsored research labs and core facilities by publication, and develop impact tracking for core facilities to monitor return on investments.For research scientists, access to the public datasets through our online marketplace of scientific resources fills several purposes. It helps researchers search for expertise by specific categories in a centralized database. They can identify potential collaborators and service providers by a simple search. They can also compare prices, quality ratings, and reviews for different service providers originally listed on the eagle-i network within our centralized platform. And they can order the scientific service directly through our platform, helping them contract out experiments from their lab for which they don't have the equipment or expertise - helping save time and money.For service providers, Science Exchange aims to increase utilization and quality recognition within an open marketplace. Service providers are government funded core facilities and university labs, which have difficulty in promoting services for external use, and tracking impact of services. Science Exchange helps researchers find the facility's services in a centralized platform, and increase utilization of labs that are running below capacity. The platform also allows for tracking of all work performed, and publications resulting from work performed on the site with collaborates - making management and reporting of service labs easier.Overall, the goal of Science Exchange is to help scientists access the resources and expertise at university based institutions, that they otherwise could not find, afford, or access. ",,"Primarily, we track the number of research collaborations formed through utilization of the online marketplace. Each order on Science Exchange is essentially a contract formed between two research scientists. This helps the researcher save grant funding as they can then access low-cost expertise at another lab, without having to order new equipment. This also helps the service labs run at capacity, as they are federally funded and required to operate at capacity. We also track research publications resulting from the collaborations on our platform, as the platform expands their scope by helping engage in larger studies otherwise not possible.","Science Exchange is a venture backed company, but one with a strong social mission open science access.We were started as a part of the Y Combinator incubator program, and have received funding from some of the top VC firms including Andreessen Horowitz, O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, and Union Square Ventures.
